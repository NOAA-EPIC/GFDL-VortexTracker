# üåä GFDL Vortex Tracker üåÄ

  This program tracks the average of the max or min of several parameters in the vicinity of an input
first guess (lat,lon) position of a vortex in order to give forecast position estimates for that vortex for
given numerical model.  For the levels 700 & 850 mb, the tracked parameters are:
Relative vorticity (max), wind magnitude (min), and geopotential height (min). 
Also tracked is the min in the MSLP. So many parameters are tracked in order to provide more accurate 
position estimates for weaker storms, which often have poorly defined structures/centers.
Currently, the system is set up to be able to process GRIB input data files from the GFS, MRF, UKMET, GDAS,
ECMWF, NGM, NAM and FNMOC/NAVGEM models. Two 1-line files are  output from this program, both containing the 
forecast fix positions that the  tracker has obtained.  One of these  output files contains the positions at 
every 12 hours from forecast hour 0 to the end of the forecast. The other file is in ATCF format, which is 
the particular format needed by the Tropical Prediction Center, and provides the positions at forecast hours
12, 24, 36, 48 and 72, plus the maximum wind near the storm center at each of those forecast hours.

For more documentation on how the tracker runs in genesis mode or the wind radii and axisymmetric diagnostic schemes please see genesisdoc.md and radiidoc.md, respectively.

## Dependices, Installation, Compiling, Running, Testing

The following external libraries are required for buildig the vortex tracker:
  * NETCDF and Fortran (77/90)
  * Fortran standard compiler
  * PNG
  * Jasper
  * Zlib
  * NCEP libraries: g2, bacio, w3nco, w3emc

### Instructions for building & installing with cmake:

The tracker is currently set up to compile and install on RDHPC systems: Gaea, Jet, Hera, PPAN, Orion, and WCOSS2.
There are two ways to use the cmake build:

### Option 1 (automatic) ###
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-VortexTracker.git
cd code/
cd src/
./run-cmake.sh
```

### Option 2 (manual) ###
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-VortexTracker.git
cd code/
mkdir build && cd build
source ../modulefile-setup/<name of computer>-setup.sh    # for example, ppan-setup.sh or jet-setup.sh
cmake ..
make
make install
```
<br />

‚ùó Things to know in order to successfully compile: <br />
    Some RDHPC systems require a clean module environment before compiling, <br />
    if that is the case ensure that a module purge is done first before running any cmake commands

### Running the Vortex Tracker

Before running a few steps need to be taken:
* Edit leadtimes
* Edit tcvit_date file
* Edit runscript

**Note:** This runscript is configured for bash shells, if the user is using a different shell please change necessary varibales <br />
Also, note that the runscript only works for netcdf data for the time being. <br /> <br />


**Leadtimes** <br />
Edit the `tracker_leadtimes` script with the leadtimes that match the input data <br />
These times must be in minutes <br />
The file is already populated with times as an example of what the file should look like <br />
‚ùó **Important** ‚ùóDue to the way the runscript reads the times in this file, <br />
the formatting of the times is very important. <br />
Please ensure the values in each column and row stay in the spaces they are currently in. <br /> <br />

**Runscript** <br />
` cd run/ ` <br />
Edit `runtracker.sh` with the editor of your chosing <br />
Search for the word "USER", this will bring you to all of the sections that need to be modified <br />
Follow along with the comments in the script for instructions

**tcvit_date file** <br />
`cd files/bin` <br />
Edit `tcvit_date` file
Once again, search for the word "USER" to find where paths will need to be added

### Testing the Tracker
A full testing suite is being created - tests will be added as they are completed
