# üåä GFDL Vortex Tracker üåÄ

  This program tracks the average of the max or min of several parameters in the vicinity of an input
first guess (lat,lon) position of a vortex in order to give forecast position estimates for that vortex for
given numerical model.  For the levels 700 & 850 mb, the tracked parameters are:
Relative vorticity (max), wind magnitude (min), and geopotential height (min). 
Also tracked is the min in the MSLP. So many parameters are tracked in order to provide more accurate 
position estimates for weaker storms, which often have poorly defined structures/centers.
Currently, the system is set up to be able to process GRIB input data files from the GFS, MRF, UKMET, GDAS,
ECMWF, NGM, NAM and FNMOC/NAVGEM models. Two 1-line files are  output from this program, both containing the 
forecast fix positions that the  tracker has obtained.  One of these  output files contains the positions at 
every 12 hours from forecast hour 0 to the end of the forecast. The other file is in ATCF format, which is 
the particular format needed by the Tropical Prediction Center, and provides the positions at forecast hours
12, 24, 36, 48 and 72, plus the maximum wind near the storm center at each of those forecast hours.

For more documentation on how the tracker runs in genesis mode or the wind radii and axisymmetric diagnostic schemes please see genesisdoc.md and radiidoc.md, respectively.

## Dependices, Installation, Compiling, Running
‚ö†Ô∏è IN CONSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

The following external libraries are required for buildig the vortex tracker:
  * NETCDF and Fortran (77/90)
  * Fortran standard compiler
  * PNG
  * Jasper
  * Zlib
  * NCEP libraries: g2, bacio, w3nco, w3emc

### Instructions for building & installing with cmake:

As of right now, building & installing with cmake is only setup to work on RDHPCS systems Hera, Jet, and 
Orion. 
If on one of these systems :
  1.      module load cmake
  2.      cd src/
  3.      ./build_all_cmake.sh

‚ùó Stay tuned for building instructions for other systems ‚ùó
